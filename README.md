The aim of this assignment is to master modern tools (TensorFlow and Keras) for training deep networks. This paper is structured as follows: first, we will provide a proof-of-understanding on three types of deep networks: convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and autoencoders. For this, we studied and slightly adapted pre-existing tutorials and examples. For each of the three types we will describe the network, the problem we selected, the data, the experiment and the results. We will also mention which adaptations were made to the original example. 

Next, we will apply deep learning to an original data set. In particular, a character-based RNN will be trained on tweets from U.S. president Trump, and this network will be used to generate president Trump's 'next tweet'. Finally, this paper will conclude with a brief discussion on this experiment, our findings and suggestions for further research.
